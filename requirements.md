Product Requirements Document (PRD): Feasibility and Financial Analysis
________________________________________
1. Project Overview
Feasibility and Financial Analysis is a bilingual (English/Arabic), highly interactive web-based application designed for comprehensive project feasibility studies and financial planning. It supports in-depth capital investment modeling, cost forecasting, financial evaluation (NPV, IRR, ROI), risk simulations (Monte Carlo), dynamic Gantt chart scheduling, and natural language (AI-powered) reporting. It is intended for use by planners, consultants, government entities, and investors across various sectors.
This document provides a deep dive into each module of the system, including precise input fields, data flows, financial calculations, formulas, visualization methods, AI tasks, and report outputs. The system is architected to use a hybrid tech stack with client-heavy interactions and optional server-side modules for persistence, AI computation, document generation, and integration.
